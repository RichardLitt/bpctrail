Bonnie Prince Charlie infamously lead the [1745 Jacobite Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_rising_of_1745) in Scotland, ending at the Battle of Culloden on April 16th. From there, he fled with some loyal retainers to the west coast of Scotland, where he took ship to the Hebrides. There's a trail for the Bonnie Prince Charlie trek there - but there isn't one from Culloden.

We're hoping to change that.

[Richard Littauer](https://burntfen.com) and Kyle Smith are walking the trail of Bonnie Prince Charlie from Culloden to Loch nan Uamh in April, 2022. Follow along for updates on our quest!
